### Data Collection 
- Where did you get your data from?
We scraped data using Apify (https://apify.com/) and collected comments on videos about extraterrestrials published on Tiktok.
We focused on a time range going from September 15, 2020 to November 21, 2025. 

- What's youd data about? 
Our data presents the most frequent words used in the comments for the 10 most popular videos of our original dataseas as a word cloud (one word cloud per video). Underneath each of the word clouds, we added in what percentage the comments are positive, negative, or neutral. 
Since the data is about aliens, we decided to encapsulate the word cloud in the shape of different UFOs, as they are commonly depicted in the media. 

- Who is/are the sources/creators of your data?
We created the datasets using Apify's tools to gather comments to TikTok videos on our own.

### Data Organization 
- Have you combined data from different sources? How did you merge them? 
We only used one dataset. 

- What columns are more relevant for your project? 
The most important colums were the comments, in order to create the word clouds, as well as the evaluation of the comments' sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral). 

- Have you used any AI-based tool to understand or manipulate your data? If yes, and how? 
We didn't rely on AI.
